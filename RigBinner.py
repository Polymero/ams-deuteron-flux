# Create histograms for the different rigidity slices. Print a single histo plot that shows the ranges and their occupancy. Only the occupance numbers are useful.
# Also return bin widths and livetime for each rigidity slice in order to create the rate. How to get the livetime as a function of rigidity? Ask Eduardo?
